## Rules to add new website

1. Add only the main domain. For example for "**my.panel.domain.ca.uk**", simply add "**domain.ca.uk**"
2. Add a domain to the [white-list.txt](white-list.txt) only if account deletion is easy and does not require additional steps
3. Add a domain to the [black-list.txt](black-list.txt) if account deletion is not possible or requires additional steps, such as contacting customer support
