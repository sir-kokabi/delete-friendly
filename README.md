# Delete Friendly - Chrome extension
This extension lets you know whether a website allows you to delete your account only with "one click and bang!" without any extra steps like contact with customer support, or others ifs and buts. 

This helps you think twice before registering for a website.

## How to install
1. [Download the extension](https://github.com/sir-kokabi/delete-friendly/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract zip on the desktop.
2. Open chrome extensions panel by visiting `chrome://extensions`.
3. Turn `developer mode` on.
4. Drag `src` folder into extensions panel.
5. Now whenever you want to signup in a website ,take a look at the extension. If it says **YES** with a green background, you can safely signup for that website because you can delete your account at any time. If it says **No** with a red background, you should think twice. You might want to signup using a temporary email address!
