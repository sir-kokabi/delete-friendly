# Delete Friendly - Chrome extension
This extension lets you know if a website allows you to delete your account only with "one click and bang!" or not; without any other procedure, contact with customer support, or other ifs and buts. This helps you think twice before registering for a web site.

## Contributing
You can make this extension better by:
1. [Adding new websites](#Rules-to-add-new-website)
2. Reporting issues and offer new functionality
3. Resolving reported issues and code development

## Rules to add new website

1. Add only the main domain. For example for "**my.panel.domain.ca.uk**", simply add "**domain.ca.uk**"
2. Add a domain to the [white-list.txt](white-list.txt) only if account deletion is easy and does not require additional steps
3. Add a domain to the [black-list.txt](black-list.txt) if account deletion is not possible or requires additional steps, such as contacting customer
