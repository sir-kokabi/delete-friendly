# Delete Friendly Chrome extension
This extension tells you if a website lets you delete your account with just "**one click and bang**" without any further procedures, contact with customer support, or other "ifs and buts".

## Contributing
You can make this extension better by:
1. Adding new websites to white-list.txt or black-list.txt
2. Reporting issues and suggesting new features
3. Coding and resolving reported issues or any other code development.

## Rules to add new website

1. Only add the main domain. For example for "**my.panel.domain.ca.uk**", just add "**domain.ca.uk**"
2. Add a domain to the **white-list** only if it provides an easy way to delete account. That means, one click and delete, without any extra steps.
3. Add a domain to the **black list** if deleting account requires additional steps, such as contacting customer support or addressing any ifs and buts.
